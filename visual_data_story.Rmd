## Plot 1 - Comparing lateness of Frequent and Local buses.

![Local buses seem to be more late than Frequent buses](plot1.png)

For Plot 1, I decided to compare local and frequent buses and how often they are
late. The bus type was a new addition, because I didn't specify it before. Shown
in the plot, local buses always seems to be more late compared to the frequent 
buses, although not by a significant amount. But then again, it was only a sample
of 20 total, 10 each for the bus type, so more data could produce a better conclusion.


## Plot 2 - Comparing mean minutes of early and delayed

![Delayed buses seem to have higher variability](plot2.png)
For Plot 2, I wanted to know if there was a difference when it came to how many
minutes a bus is delayed or early by - if they were any different. It seems that
delayed buses have a much higher variation than early buses, but the means are
very close to each other. I think delayed buses have more variation because it 
happens more often than early, with factors like traffic.

## Plot 3 - comparing on time and delayed buses with time logged

![On time seems to happen more often compared to delayed](plot3.png)


For Plot 3, I decided to see which status happened more during the time I Logged
these observations. As shown on the graph, on time happens more often than delayed
buses - during the time I logged them in anyway. This is only data from local
and frequent buses, so the sample is small. I would guess the delayed mostly came
from local buses. I logged most of this data when it was morning or afternoon.
